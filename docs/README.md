## Introduction
Apache Aurora is a service scheduler that runs on top of Apache Mesos, enabling you to run long-running services that take advantage of Apache Mesos' scalability, fault-tolerance, and resource isolation. This documentation has been organized into sections with three audiences in mind:

 * Users: General information about the project and to learn how to run an Aurora job.
 * Operators: For those that wish to manage and fine-tune an Aurora cluster.
 * Developers: All the information you need to start modifying Aurora and contributing back to the project.

We encourage you to ask questions on the [Aurora developer list](http://aurora.apache.org/community/) or the `#aurora` IRC channel on `irc.freenode.net`.
